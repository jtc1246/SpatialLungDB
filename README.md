## Introduction

COVID-Lung CosMX is an AI-powered, user-friendly, and open-access platform for analyzing spatial CosMX (NanoString) data. It features first-hand data from explant and autopsy lung samples of patients infected with COVID-19, as well as samples from non-COVID-19 subjects. This platform provides a systematic analysis of cellular responses and molecular changes in COVID-19-infected lungs, all at a high-resolution 3D spatial scale.
